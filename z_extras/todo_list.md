# OBS-TV-Animator TODO List

## Priority: High (Security & Production Ready)

- [ ] **Fix production deployment issues**
  - Use eventlet or gevent, remove 'allow_unsafe_werkzeug=True' from app.py
  - Replace development Flask server with proper production WSGI server (gunicorn)
  - Update Docker configuration for production deployment

## Priority: Medium (Integration & Features)

- [ ] **Add OBS WebSocket Client Integration**
  - Research and implement `obs-websocket-py` library integration
  - Add OBS WebSocket client functionality to Flask server (OBS acts as server, we connect as client)
  - Enable bidirectional OBS communication (scene detection, control commands)
  - Architecture: Our Flask App → connects to → OBS WebSocket Server (port 4455/4444)
  - **NOTE**: OBS cannot connect to external servers, only acts as WebSocket server
  - Integration will enable scene change detection and automated scene switching
  - **Add "Manage OBS Server" button to Quick Actions card** - there's space for exactly one more button without layout changes
  - Button should allow configuration of OBS WebSocket server settings (host, port, password)
  - Update README screenshot after OBS management button is added

## Priority: Low (Code Organization & Cleanup)

- [ ] **Refactor current HTML examples**
  - Use as scaffold for future overlay development
  - Ensure overlay contains connected icon, request change, and screen refresh handlers
  - Standardize overlay components across all animation types

- [ ] **Repository cleanup**
  - Remove unnecessary testing files from main repo
  - Archive or document z_extras files before removal
  - Clean up file structure and organization

- [ ] **Verify Setup/Instructions page(s) contents for accuracy**
  - Verify that the current setup and usage instructions reflects the current version of the project.

- [ ] **Update StreamerBot setup instructions**
  - Add detailed instructions for creating Actions and Sub-Actions in StreamerBot
  - Document both HTTP (Fetch URL) and C# (Execute C# Code) integration methods
  - Include step-by-step screenshots for Actions → Add Action workflow
  - Add examples of event triggers (Follow, Donation, Chat Command, etc.)
  - Explain the difference between HTTP GET vs POST methods for different use cases
  - Add troubleshooting section for common StreamerBot integration issues

- [ ] **Documentation Review & Cleanup**
  - Review all instruction pages (Getting Started, OBS, StreamerBot, Troubleshooting) for accuracy
  - Check for outdated references, broken links, or confusing sections
  - Ensure all code examples and URLs are current and working
  - Verify mobile responsiveness of instruction pages
  - Update any screenshots or visual examples if needed

## Priority: Low (Animation Template Ideas)

- [ ] **Subscriber celebration with profile image integration**
  - StreamerBot integration to capture new subscriber events
  - Dynamic profile image display from Twitch/YouTube API
  - Personalized confetti animation with subscriber's avatar
  - WebSocket data flow: StreamerBot → Flask server → Animation
  - Real-world example of event-driven, data-rich animations

- [ ] **Additional template ideas for future development**
  - "Welcome Raiders" screen for background scene visibility
  - Goal progress tracker with dynamic updates
  - "Starting Soon" countdown with streamer branding
  - Technical difficulties holding screen
  - New follower celebration burst animation
