# OBS-TV-Animator TODO List

## Priority: High (Security & Production Ready)

- [ ] **Fix production deployment issues**
  - Use eventlet or gevent, remove 'allow_unsafe_werkzeug=True' from app.py
  - Replace development Flask server with proper production WSGI server (gunicorn)
  - Update Docker configuration for production deployment

## Priority: Medium (Documentation & User Experience)

- [ ] **Create comprehensive documentation**
  - Update README.md as quick setup guide with Docker instructions
  - Add note in README to see detailed usage page in admin panel after deployment
  - Create installation, setup, and usage instructions page in admin portal

- [ ] **Add preview images to README.md**
  - Screenshot of Smart TV display showing live animations
  - Admin dashboard interface showing user management and file uploads
  - Example of real-time switching between animations
  - OBS/StreamerBot integration demonstration

- [ ] **Add instructions/usage page to admin interface**
  - Setup instructions for OBS Studio integration
  - StreamerBot configuration and webhook setup
  - Manual terminal/PowerShell command examples for testing
  - WebSocket API documentation and examples

- [ ] **Repurpose redundant refresh button as instructions button**
  - Convert the refresh button in "Quick Actions" card to "Instructions" button
  - Keep the existing refresh button in bottom-right corner (avoid duplication)
  - Link instructions button to the new usage page when created
  - Update button styling and icon (fa-book or fa-question-circle)

## Priority: Low (Code Organization & Cleanup)

- [ ] **Refactor current HTML examples**
  - Use as scaffold for future overlay development
  - Ensure overlay contains connected icon, request change, and screen refresh handlers
  - Standardize overlay components across all animation types

- [ ] **Repository cleanup**
  - Remove unnecessary testing files from main repo
  - Archive or document z_extras files before removal
  - Clean up file structure and organization

- [ ] **Additional**
  - Add onclick listener to floating mascot for easter egg functionality (simple thank you message or interactive element)
