# OBS-TV-Animator TODO List

## Priority: High (Security & Production Ready)

- [ ] **Fix production deployment issues**
  - Use eventlet or gevent, remove 'allow_unsafe_werkzeug=True' from app.py
  - Replace development Flask server with proper production WSGI server (gunicorn)
  - Update Docker configuration for production deployment

- [ ] **Implement Password Security**
  - **CRITICAL**: Replace plain text password storage with proper hashing
  - Use `werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash` and `check_password_hash`
  - Update user creation and authentication flows to use hashed passwords
  - **Security Risk**: Currently passwords stored in plain text in users.json
  - **Impact**: Essential for any production deployment or user sharing

- [ ] **Add API Rate Limiting & Input Validation**
  - Implement Flask-Limiter for API endpoint protection against abuse
  - Add proper request validation for all API endpoints (file uploads, user management, triggers)
  - Consider using marshmallow or pydantic for schema validation
  - **Security Risk**: Current API endpoints have no protection against malicious requests

## Priority: Medium (Integration & Features)

- [ ] **Implement Proper Logging Framework**
  - Replace print statements with Python logging module
  - Add rotating file handler for log management
  - Implement log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
  - **Benefits**: Better debugging, production monitoring, troubleshooting support
  - **Current Issue**: Print statements make production debugging difficult

- [ ] **Add Configuration Management System**
  - Create proper `config.py` with environment-based configurations
  - Use environment variables for sensitive data (ports, secrets, OBS passwords)
  - Consider `python-dotenv` for local development configuration
  - **Benefits**: Better deployment flexibility, security, environment separation

- [ ] **OBS Connection Stability Monitoring**
  - Monitor OBS WebSocket connection logs over extended periods
  - Identify patterns in connection drops (time-based, activity-based, etc.)
  - Document frequency and triggers for disconnection events
  - Analyze logs for specific error patterns or OBS Studio behavior
  - Consider implementing connection health metrics/dashboard
  - **Current Status**: Max retry attempts increased to 20, basic monitoring in place
  - **Goal**: Determine if disconnects are random, time-based, or triggered by specific OBS actions

- [ ] **Refactor app.py into Modular Components** 
  - **PLANNING REQUIRED**: Analyze current app.py structure and identify logical separation points
  - **Primary Candidates for Extraction**:
    - **OBS Integration Module** (`obs_manager.py`): OBSWebSocketClient class, scene list management, connection handling
    - **Scene Watcher Module** (`scene_watcher.py`): OBSSceneWatcher class, file monitoring, animation triggering
    - **Authentication Module** (`auth_manager.py`): User management, login/logout, decorators
    - **Media Management Module** (`media_manager.py`): File operations, thumbnail generation, media discovery
    - **WebSocket Handler Module** (`websocket_handlers.py`): SocketIO event handlers, client management
  - **Benefits**: Improved maintainability, easier testing, cleaner separation of concerns
  - **Considerations**: Maintain existing functionality, minimize import circular dependencies
  - **Approach**: Create detailed refactoring plan before implementation to avoid breaking changes
  - **Current Status**: app.py is ~3300 lines - needs strategic modularization

## Priority: Low (Code Organization & Cleanup)

- [ ] **Fix development server initialization**
  - The dev_local.py file needs proper fix for automation initialization with Flask reloader
  - Currently causing double initialization issues during development
  - A backup copy of the original working dev_local.py is saved in the local VS-Code directory for reference
  - Current version works adequately for development but needs improvement for future use
  - The reloader detection approach didn't resolve the issue properly

- [ ] **Create Reusable Header Template for Admin Pages**
  - Extract common header structure from admin templates into `templates/partials/admin_header.html`
  - Current duplication: Header code is repeated across 5+ admin templates (dashboard, manage, users, obs_management, etc.)
  - **Benefits**: DRY principles, easier maintenance, consistent navigation across all admin pages
  - **Implementation**: Create parameterized header partial with page title and conditional button visibility
  - **Scope**: Only page titles and specific action buttons differ between templates - everything else identical
  - **Priority**: Low - architectural improvement for better maintainability

- [ ] **OBS Studio Instructions Page Review**
  - Must be done after `obs-websocket-py` library integration
  - Review and update OBS Studio instruction page once WebSocket integration is implemented
  - Update screenshots and examples to reflect new WebSocket connection method
  - Remove outdated browser source references if any remain
  - Ensure instructions align with new OBS WebSocket client functionality
  - Add troubleshooting section specific to OBS WebSocket connection issues

- [ ] **Update StreamerBot "Common Stream Events" animation suggestions**
  - Must be done after starter animation templates are complete
  - Review and update the "Suggested Animation" recommendations in the StreamerBot integration page
  - Replace generic anim1-4.html suggestions with more specific, purpose-built animations
  - Align suggestions with expanded starter animation library after more animations are built
  - Consider event-specific animations (follow celebrations, donation displays, raid entrances, etc.)

- [ ] **Add StreamerBot Sample Integrations section with import strings**
  - Must be done after starter animation templates are complete
  - Import string must be generated in streamerbot
  - Create "Sample Integrations" section in StreamerBot integration page
  - Add copy-to-clipboard StreamerBot import string for instant setup examples
  - Include pre-configured actions for common events (Follow, Donation, Raid, Subscribe)
  - Actions should reference the base animations that ship with the project
  - Users can click "Import Actions" in StreamerBot and paste the JSON for instant working examples
  - Provide both C# WebSocket and HTTP Fetch URL action examples
  - Include proper trigger configurations and sub-action setup in the import data

## Priority: Low (Animation Template Ideas)

- [ ] **Subscriber celebration with profile image integration**
  - StreamerBot integration to capture new subscriber events
  - Dynamic profile image display from Twitch/YouTube API
  - Personalized confetti animation with subscriber's avatar
  - WebSocket data flow: StreamerBot → Flask server → Animation
  - Real-world example of event-driven, data-rich animations

- [ ] **Additional template ideas for future development**
  - "Welcome Raiders" screen for background scene visibility
  - Goal progress tracker with dynamic updates
  - "Starting Soon" countdown with streamer branding
  - Technical difficulties holding screen
  - New follower celebration burst animation

## Priority: Low (Additional Features)

- [ ] **Add Comprehensive Health Monitoring**
  - Create detailed health check endpoint with OBS connection, WebSocket client count, disk usage
  - Add system resource monitoring (memory, CPU usage)
  - Implement automatic config backup system with timestamps
  - **Benefits**: Better production monitoring, easier troubleshooting, data protection

## Priority: Optional (Potential Improvements)

- [ ] **Database Migration Path**
