## Installation

### üê≥ Docker Installation (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

#### Accessing Your Media
- **Smart TV**: Browse to `http://[DOCKER_HOST_IP]:8080`
- **WebSocket**: Connect to `ws://[DOCKER_HOST_IP]:8080/socket.io/`
- **Add Content**: Use the front end UI at `http://[DOCKER_HOST_IP]:8080/admin` to add or remove files.

### API Endpoints

#### GET `/` - View Current Animation
Opens the currently active animation in the browser. Point your Smart TV browser to this URL.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

#### POST `/trigger` - Switch Media
Update the current media (animation or video) by sending a JSON payload with the filename.

```bash
# Switch to HTML animation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"animation": "anim2.html"}'

# Switch to video file  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"animation": "my_video.mp4"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "current_animation": "anim2.html",
  "message": "Animation updated to 'anim2.html'"
}
```

#### GET `/animations` - List Available Media
Get a list of all media files in the `animations/` and `videos/` directories.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/animations
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "animations": ["anim1.html", "anim2.html", "anim3.html"],
  "videos": ["video1.mp4", "celebration.webm"],
  "all_media": ["anim1.html", "anim2.html", "anim3.html", "celebration.webm", "video1.mp4"],
  "current_animation": "anim1.html",
  "current_media": "anim1.html",
  "count": 5,
  "animation_count": 3,
  "video_count": 2
}
```

#### GET `/health` - Health Check
Check if the server is running properly.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

## Adding Media Files

### HTML Animations
1. Create an HTML file with your animation (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
2. Make sure to use inline CSS and JS in the HTML.
3. Save it in the `animations/` directory
4. Trigger it via the `/trigger` endpoint or WebSocket events
5. Use the provided HTML templates as a scaffold for your custom animations.

### Video Files
1. Add video files to the `videos/` directory
2. Supported formats: MP4, WebM, OGG, AVI, MOV, MKV
3. Videos will auto-play, auto-fullscreen, and loop on the TV or device.
4. Use MP4 with H.264 codec for best Smart TV compatibility.


## OBS & StreamerBot Integration

This server is designed to run animations on a Smart TV while receiving WebSocket commands from OBS or StreamerBot for scene changes and events. The TV displays the animations while OBS and StreamerBot trigger changes remotely.

### Method 1: OBS WebSocket Plugin
Use the OBS WebSocket plugin to send scene change events:

```javascript
// Example OBS WebSocket script
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080/socket.io/');

// Trigger animation on scene change
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  event: 'scene_change',
  data: {
    scene_name: 'Gaming'
  }
}));
```

### Method 2: StreamerBot Integration
Configure StreamerBot to send WebSocket events for advanced automation:

```javascript
// StreamerBot WebSocket event
{
  "event_type": "trigger_animation",
  "data": {
    "animation": "anim2.html"
  }
}
```

### Method 3: REST API (Legacy Support)
Still supports HTTP REST API calls for backwards compatibility:

```bash
# When switching to a specific scene
curl -X POST http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"animation": "anim2.html"}'
```

## WebSocket Events API

Connect to `ws://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080/socket.io/` to send real-time events:

### Available Events

#### `trigger_animation`
Change the current media (animation or video) instantly:
```json
{
  "animation": "anim2.html"
}
```
```json
{
  "animation": "my_video.mp4"
}
```

#### `scene_change` 
Trigger animations based on OBS scene names:
```json
{
  "scene_name": "Gaming",
  "animation_mapping": {
    "gaming": "anim1.html",
    "chatting": "anim2.html",
    "brb": "anim3.html"
  }
}
```

#### `streamerbot_event`
Handle StreamerBot events with automatic mapping:
```json
{
  "event_type": "scene_change",
  "data": {
    "scene_name": "Gaming"
  }
}
```

#### `video_control`
Control video playback (only works when current media is a video):
```json
{
  "action": "play"
}
```
```json
{
  "action": "pause"
}
```
```json
{
  "action": "seek",
  "value": 30
}
```
```json
{
  "action": "volume", 
  "value": 0.8
}
```

#### `get_status`
Request current server status (no data required).

### Server Responses

- `animation_changed`: Broadcast when animation changes
- `status`: Current server state
- `error`: Error messages
- `info`: Informational messages

## Smart TV Setup

### üê≥ Docker Deployment
1. Find your Docker host IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
2. Start the container: `docker-compose up -d`
3. On your Smart TV, open the web browser
4. Navigate to: `http://192.168.1.100:8080`
5. The current media will display full-screen
6. Content changes automatically when triggered via WebSocket, API, or the 'admin' page.

## Tips

- **Auto-refresh:** Add a refresh timer to your animations using JavaScript
- **Responsive Design:** Use viewport units (vw, vh) for TV-friendly sizing
- **Performance:** Keep animations lightweight for Smart TV browsers
- **Testing:** Use your desktop browser to preview before deploying to TV
